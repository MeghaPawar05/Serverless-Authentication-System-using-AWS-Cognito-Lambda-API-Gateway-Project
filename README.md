👉 Serverless API with Authentication using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and Cognito


🚀 Project Explanation – *Serverless API with Authentication*



---

### *Architecture Flow*

1. *User Authentication (Cognito):*

   * End-users first sign up or log in using *Amazon Cognito User Pool*.
   * Cognito generates a *JWT token* (ID/Access token) after successful authentication.

2. *API Gateway:*

   * Users send requests (with JWT token in headers) to the *Amazon API Gateway* endpoint.
   * API Gateway verifies the token with *Cognito Authorizer*.
   * If valid, API Gateway forwards the request to the backend.
   * If invalid, request is rejected.

3. *AWS Lambda Function:*

   * API Gateway triggers your *Lambda function*.
   * Lambda executes your custom business logic (e.g., CRUD operations, fetching data, etc.).
   * Returns the response back to API Gateway.

4. *Client Access:*

   * The response is sent back to the authenticated user’s application (web, mobile, or browser).



### *Key AWS Services Used*

* *AWS Lambda* → Serverless compute to run your backend code.
* *Amazon API Gateway* → Acts as an API front door to securely expose Lambda.
* *Amazon Cognito* → Provides user authentication & token-based access.
* *CloudWatch Logs* (optional) → For monitoring Lambda execution.


### *Benefits*

✅ *Serverless* → No servers to manage, fully managed services.
✅ *Scalable* → Automatically scales with traffic.
✅ *Secure* → Cognito ensures only authenticated users can access APIs.
✅ *Cost-efficient* → Pay only for usage.


### *Use Case Example*

Let’s say you’re building a *Notes App*:

* Users register & login with Cognito.
* After login, they get a JWT token.
* The token is sent with requests to API Gateway (e.g., POST /notes, GET /notes).
* API Gateway checks the token with Cognito.
* Lambda stores or retrieves notes from a database (DynamoDB or RDS).
* The response goes back securely to the user.
